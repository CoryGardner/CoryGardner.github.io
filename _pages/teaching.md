## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in creating an inclusive learning environment that encourages critical thinking and practical application of concepts. My approach combines:

* **Interactive learning**: Engaging students through hands-on exercises and real-world examples
* **Concept visualization**: Using diagrams and code examples to illustrate complex ideas
* **Scaffolded learning**: Building knowledge incrementally from fundamentals to advanced topics
* **Collaborative problem-solving**: Encouraging peer-to-peer learning through group projects
