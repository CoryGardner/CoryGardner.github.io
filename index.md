I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Saint Louis University, working under the supervision of [Dr. Tae-Hyuk Ahn](https://cs.slu.edu/~ahn/) in the [Ahn Lab](https://ahnlab.github.io/). My research focuses on the intersection of computational biology, high-performance computing, and machine learning applications in genomics.

## Research Interests

* **Computational Biology & Genomics**: Advanced sequence representation methods, multimodal deep learning for integrated genomic analysis
* **High-Performance Computing**: GPU-accelerated image analysis, parallel algorithm optimization for large-scale genomic datasets
* **Machine Learning Privacy & Security**: Membership inference attack detection, federated learning for healthcare data privacy

## Recent News

* **March 2025**: Our paper on metagenomics analysis of blood and tissues was accepted for publication by Briefings in Bioinformatics
