I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Saint Louis University, working under the supervision of Dr. Tae-Hyuk Ahn in the [Ahn Lab](https://cs.slu.edu/~ahn). My research focuses on the intersection of computational biology, high-performance computing, and machine learning applications in genomics.

## Research Interests

* **Computational Biology & Genomics**: Advanced sequence representation methods, multimodal deep learning for integrated genomic analysis
* **High-Performance Computing**: GPU-accelerated image analysis, parallel algorithm optimization for large-scale genomic datasets
* **Machine Learning Privacy & Security**: Membership inference attack detection, federated learning for healthcare data privacy

## Recent News
* **April 2025** – I was awarded the [Frontera Fellowship](https://frontera-portal.tacc.utexas.edu/fellowship/) from the Texas Advanced Computing Center!
* **April 2025** – I attained PhD candidate status after passing my qualifying exams.
* **March 2025** – Our paper on metagenomic analysis of blood and tissue samples was accepted for publication in *Briefings in Bioinformatics*.
* **September 2024** – Our paper *Chromosome-level subgenome-aware de novo assembly of Saccharomyces bayanus provides insight into genome divergence after hybridization* was published in *Genome Research*.
