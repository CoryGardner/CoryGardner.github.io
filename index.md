I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Saint Louis University, working under the supervision of Dr. Tae-Hyuk Ahn in the [Ahn Lab](https://cs.slu.edu/~ahn). My research focuses on the intersection of computational biology, high-performance computing, and machine learning applications in genomics.

## Research Interests

* **Computational Biology & Genomics**: Advanced sequence representation methods, multimodal deep learning for integrated genomic analysis
* **High-Performance Computing**: GPU-accelerated image analysis, parallel algorithm optimization for large-scale genomic datasets
* **Machine Learning Privacy & Security**: Membership inference attack detection, federated learning for healthcare data privacy

## Recent News
* **September 2024**: Our paper "Chromosome-level subgenome-aware de novo assembly of Saccharomyces bayanus provides insight into genome divergence after hybridization" was published by [Genome Biology](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2024/09/17/gr.279364.124.abstract%22).
* **March 2025**: Our paper on the metagenomics analysis of blood and tissues was accepted for publication by Briefings in Bioinformatics
